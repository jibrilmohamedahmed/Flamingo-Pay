##  Core Modules & Technologies

###  1. Voice Interaction (No Screen Required)
- **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text** – Processes user voice commands
- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech** – Reads system responses aloud
- **Flutter** – Front-end built with cross-platform UI toolkit
- **Amharic + English** – Language selection via voice

###  2. Authentication & eKYC
- **Voice PIN** – Spoken numeric PIN used to log in
- **Voice Biometrics** – Used to confirm user identity
- **eKYC Document Capture** – Via phone camera
- **OCR** – Custom backend with Tesseract.js for ID scanning
- **Liveness Check** – Randomized voice phrase matching

###  3. UPI Transaction Engine
- Built in **Node.js (Express)**
- Handles:
  - `check_balance`
  - `send_money`
  - `transaction_history`
- Future-ready integration with **EthSwitch API**
